CST 205 Team 8244 README

Project Name: Virtual Piano

Names: Victor Rodriguez, Jaime Serrano Acevedo, Leonardo Lopez, Douglas McDonald

How To Run: Make sure PySide6, NumPy PyDub, and Audioop-Lts (pip install audioop-lts, this is used to fix an issue with PyDub on the newest Python versions) are installed. Then, run main.py which should open the main menu. This screen will allow you to choose between two buttons, one which opens the tutorials, which will teach you the basics and helpful information about playing piano and simple music theory. The piano screen will present 13 keys, 5 black and 8 white, and each of them will make their corresponding sound when they are pressed, either by clicking on the key with a mouse, or pressing a specific key on the keyboard. The white keys are controlled with A S D F G H J K, and the black keys are controlled by W E T Y U.
